      <description>I am going to give a talk highlighting elementary concepts in online advertising. It is a good time to review all the basics.
Advertiser Organizations that want to promote a product through different media either directly or through other buyers.
DSP Demand-side platforms receive an ad request that they must answer by a time set by the SSP or ad exchange. The time allowed can be as low as 100 ms and range up to a few seconds.</description>

      <title>Compress Url Parameters Without a Storage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In advertising and other online marketing fields, a common practice is to distribute URLs to the clients so that they can report user action through a simple GET request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those parameters are fake. But you got the idea. Longer URLs mean higher bandwidth consumption. Moreover, if your URL is too long, you will risk triggering &lt;strong&gt;Error 413: request entity too large&lt;/strong&gt;. I know nginx throws it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We have carried out the first or maybe last round of rewrite of the Juhui DSP/SSP/ADX with Typescript. A few goals and non-goals have been set for this labor-intensive process.
Goals  Strong typed. Strong API contracts. Holistic Observability with logging, tracing, and metrics. Layered Architecture and dedicated component. Testcases can be run by anyone. Stateless over stateful. Improved readability. Proper code deprecation process.  Non-Goals  Use fancy technology.</description>

      <title>Realtime Query Oriented Data Structure for DMP</title>

      <description>DMP stands for Data Management Platform, and per Wikipedia, it is a technology platform used for collecting and managing data, mainly for digital marketing purposes. To put it simply, DMP is a collection of data about user attributes.
As you might expect a DMP may contain more than millions of data. The DMP I worked on contained nearly a billion. Open source toolings such as Elasticsearch provided a good average baseline for data analytics, and reasonable response time for general-purpose querying.</description>
