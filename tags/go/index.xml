      <description>The twelve-factor methodology has proven its worth over the years. Since its invention many fields in technology have changed, many among them are shining and exciting. In the age of Kubernetes, service mesh and serverless architectures, the twelve-factor methodology has not faded away, but rather has happened to be a good fit for nearly all of those powerful platforms.
Scaffolding a twelve-factor go app may not be a difficult task for experienced engineers, but certainly presents some challenges to juniors.</description>

      <description>最近用go搞了一个swoole的边车。是真的边车，用swoole process启动的。挂载到swoole server上跑，swoole起它起，swoole停它停，中间如果go挂了swoole还负责给拉起来。消息投递也照搬swoole task走IPC，从web worker上直接投递，等结果出来再返还web worker。</description>

      <description>When we started huijiwiki.com, PHP was the language of the choice. But it was not much a choice. MediaWiki was coded in PHP. It provided us a solid starting point to expand our idea.
Since then I have touched many languages and am moderately proficient in some of them. Among them, Go is my current favorite. Rust is the language I want to explore more.
Go as well as Rust has a very different nature compared to PHP.</description>

      <description>Vue community exploded due to changes in Vue 3. Some comments are full of gunpowder with regards to the recent functional API RFC. Let me show my opinions up front:
 A. OSS authors clearly deserve more respect.
 B. I think functional API generally are more expressive compared to the old one.
  However I would like to provide a counter argument to a very point the defender of RFC made.</description>
