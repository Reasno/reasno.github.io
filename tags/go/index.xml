      <description>When we started huijiwiki.com, PHP was the language of the choice. But it was not much a choice. MediaWiki was coded in PHP. It provided us a solid starting point to expand our idea.
Since then I have touched many languages and am moderately proficient in some of them. Among them, Go is my current favorite. Rust is the language I want to explore more.
Go as well as Rust has a very different nature compared to PHP.</description>

      <description>Vue community exploded due to changes in Vue 3. Some comments are full of gunpowder with regards to the recent functional API RFC. Let me show my opinions up front:
 A. OSS authors clearly deserve more respect.
 B. I think functional API generally are more expressive compared to the old one.
  However I would like to provide a counter argument to a very point the defender of RFC made.</description>
