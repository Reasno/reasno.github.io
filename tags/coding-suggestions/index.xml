      <description>We have carried out the first or maybe last round of rewrite of Juhui ad platform. A few goals and non-goals has been set for this labor-intensive process.
Goals:  Strong typed. Strong API contracts. Holistic Observability with logging, tracing and metrics. Layered Architecture and dedicated component. Testcases can be run by anyone. Stateless over stateful. Improved readability. Proper code deprecation process.  Non-Goals:  Use fancy technology. Reinvent the wheel.</description>
