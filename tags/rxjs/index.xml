      <title>Beware of Backpressure</title>

      <description>One of my junior dev was frustrated today. He was supposed to read from a file stream with NodeJS, piping that into the database. However, he got errors thrown everywhere when dealing with larger files. I helped him identified the problem. He had been dumping async calls (the database insertion) faster than the call could be handled.
I remotely remember I run into a similar issue years ago when I wrote a web scraper in NodeJS.</description>

      <title>Id Based Throttling</title>

      <description>RxJS is bonkers!
Imagine you have an unbounded stream of events. Each has a unique id. Now you want to throttle the stream based on id, ie. each id should not appear more often than X minutes.
With RxJS:
// Throttle each id in one minute. fromEvent(emitter, &amp;#39;tick&amp;#39;).pipe( groupBy((e: Event) =&amp;gt; e.getId()), flatMap(group =&amp;gt; group.pipe(throttleTime(60 * 1000))), ).subscribe( //Do your stuff ); Without RxJS:
Too much to write.</description>

      <title>Beauty of Lazy Execution</title>

      <description>I have done some quick&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;dirty bid data processing with Apache Beam in past weeks. As someone who try to stay away from JVM, I am not a big data expert at all. However the working with apache beam is a blast (Using JAVA!). The lazy execution style feels right a home. I love wiring a various component into a topology, and only start processing when data arrives.
I once heard a Haskell fan said that she thought lazy execution was what set Haskell apart from other programing languages.</description>
