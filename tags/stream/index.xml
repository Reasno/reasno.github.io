      <description>One of my junior dev was frustrated today. He was supposed to read from a file stream with NodeJS, piping that into the database. However, he got errors thrown everywhere when dealing with larger files. I helped him identified the problem. He had been dumping async calls (the database insertion) faster than the call could be handled.
I remotely remember I run into a similar issue years ago when I wrote a web scraper in NodeJS.</description>
