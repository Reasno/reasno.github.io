It seems to be a more and more accepted idea that service mesh are not for every body.

Though it is not straightforward to me that Matt, the creator of envoy, is actually dissuading people from jumping on the mesh train, his opinion is not really a freshing one. It seems to be a more and more accepted idea that service mesh are not for every body. It solves a domain of problems that only the top of the pyramid would encounter but meanwhile introduces a bunch of other headaches. I expect the interests around istio would drop considerably by the end of 2019.</p>

<p>Engineering must be practical and pragmatic. I am glad to see the industry converge on this principle.</p>
